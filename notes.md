# Notes
A pass rate is defined as the number of test which passed divided by the total number of tests that occured. We determine whether a test passes or fails by comparing a test's observed output with the output of a calculated determinstic operation.

On 1,000,000 tests of a 10-thread cycle on a 1-thread operation, we obtain a pass rate of 100.000%. <br>
On 1,000,000 tests of a 10-thread cycle on a 2-thread operation, we obtain a pass rate of 66.4875%. <br>
On 1,000,000 tests of a 10-thread cycle on a 3-thread operation, we obtain a pass rate of 64.5759%. <br>
On 1,000,000 tests of a 10-thread cycle on a 4-thread operation, we obtain a pass rate of 61.3893%. <br>
On 1,000,000 tests of a 10-thread cycle on a 5-thread operation, we obtain a pass rate of 55.8582%. <br>
